# SGFDatabase

This is just my own custom database that I use for study
It contains some current, some historical components.

   
* Romanian Games, a selection, sourced from Desprego or PEGTC
* Master Games, botto
* CGI Games, botto
* Go Seigen Games, sourced from one of the many collections I found - possibly from AEB - I forgot!
* 2017 games, pro games from 2017 I found, possibly from AEB - I forgot!

   
I use these in BaduK database software
