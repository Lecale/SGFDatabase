Last update: 2017.01.05

This is a collection of games played by "Master" and "Magist", a new version of
DeepMind's AlphaGo, in the last days of 2016 and the first days of 2017.

I have collected the games from various sources and tried to clean up the SGF
markup. Timestamps are from the server or best guesses, so because of time
zones they may be different than what was reported on forums and on social
media.

The order in which the games were played is encounded in the RO[] property
(round) and reflected in the filenames, so it is easier to talk about "game 17"
or "game 53", for example.

It is possible that there are mistakes in the game information markup, such as
the result (RE[]). Please let me know about these mistakes at marcel@cpan.org
or tell me on Twitter (@hanekomu). I will update this zip file with a new
version so the link to the zip file will stay the same.

Thanks to Andries E. Brouwer and Andrew Simons (Uberdude) for corrections.
